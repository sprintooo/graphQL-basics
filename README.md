# GraphQL Basics Learning Project

This project is designed to help understand the fundamentals of GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a complete description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Key Concepts

- **Queries**: Fetch data from the server
- **Mutations**: Modify data on the server
- **Schema**: Defines the types of data available
- **Resolvers**: Functions that determine how to fetch the data
- **Type System**: Strong typing for your API

## Project Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Dependencies

- Express.js: Web framework
- GraphQL: Query language and runtime
- Nodemon: Auto-restart server during development

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding GraphQL schema design
- Implementing queries and mutations
- Working with resolvers
- Type system in GraphQL
- Error handling
- Best practices
